# Courses Application

Courses Application is a web-based system developed in C# using Visual Studio. It is designed to manage course enrollments at a university level, with core features such as handling students, semesters, and enrollments. Students can enroll in available courses for a specific semester, while administrators can manage course offerings and student records. The application follows a layered architecture with separate Domain, Repository, Service, and Web layers, promoting clean code structure and maintainability.
